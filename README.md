# iStayHealthy-iPhone
My app for people living with HIV.
It's been on the app store for 6 years now.

Sadly, there have been issues with accessing data over the last few years. This first appeared during a period when
significant changes were made to iCloud.

Since then I have tried hard to mitigate. But after 3 years and the problem still occurring for some I throw in the towel.

I will keep the app running on the AppStore for a while, but will no longer maintain this code base.

Rather, it is time to start from scratch again and act on all the lessons I learnt from this app over the years.

It will take some time to come up with something new but it will most likely be a bit more generic than this one. Meaning, users 
should be able to monitor a lot more results and events than just the ones offered by iStayHealthy at present.
